# Smart-Advertising

## Idea
This project is made as a submission of Microsoft Engage 2022 program under Facial Recognition. <br /> 
The main idea is to promote smart advertising. Advertisement when shown to proper and target audience makes proper sense. Keeping this key concept, the project uses **facial recognition** and **age detection** to distinguish users as per their detected age and show advertisement according to that. <br />
So, 18+ advertisements will not be shown to below 18 years age users.

## Description of Project
This project web-app is inspired from Youtube web. So, the interface is similar to the Youtube web with functionalities to 
  - watch videos
  - see related videos
  - comment to a video
  - see subscribed channels
In this platform, user gets authenticated with their face first then google authentication takes place. Once, user gets into the platform and perform tasks, camera identifies the face of the user and detects its age. As per the age, advertisements are shown.
